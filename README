Simple script that polls Apple Mail and moves Todo items to The Hit List

Install:

- Place the .applescript file somewhere... anywhere it doesn't really matter
- Open the .plist file and set the path to the script (under ProgramArguments)
- Save said .plist file under ~/Library/LaunchAgents
- You may have to log out and log back in
